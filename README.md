# Private Events
In this project, I built a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.   
Also, users can create events and send invitations.    
The events take place at a specific date and location.   

If you want to know more about the project, [this](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations) is the link to The Odin Project.
